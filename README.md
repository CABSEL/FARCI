FARCI provides an efficient implementation of neuronal connectome inference from Calcium imaging neuronal activity data. FARCI outputs a partial correlation matrix, which is depicted as a circular graph, representing the neuronal connectome. When neuronal spatial information is available, the neuronal connectome also accounts for the position of neurons.
  
The repository contains two datasets from the [Neural Connectomics Challenge](https://connectomics.chalearn.org/). 
10 more *in-silico* dataset generated using [NAOMi](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0165027021001084) toolbox can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1buXtW0HUcJZubryjNc4-hCgP8BpAlcJX).
