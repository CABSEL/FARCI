FARCI provides an efficient implementation of neuronal connectome inference from Calcium imaging neuronal activity data. FARCI outputs a partial correlation matrix, which is depicted as a circular graph, representing the neuronal connectome. When neuronal spatial information is available, the neuronal connectome also accounts for the position of neurons.
